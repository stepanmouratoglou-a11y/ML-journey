# ML-journey
In this repository I upload some small projects as I progress my knowledge on machine learning.
This repository includes some ipynb notebooks with supervised and unsupervised learning.
Most of the datasets are acquired from Kaggle, here is the link to the dataset of the K-Means Clustering notebook which was accesed from a github repo: https://github.com/vicky60629/Segmentation-of-Credit-Card-Customers/blob/master/CC_GENERAL.csv
